# Yaegel-Tech - Luke Yaegel's Personal Website

**UPDATE (9/2019)** - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - This site has been taken down and will be replaced by a Spring Boot site instead. 

## Description
My personal website built using Spring MVC, JSP, Maven, and the Spring Tool Suite.

Moving forward, I plan to add a MySQL database, Hibernate, AngularJS, and many other libraries and components.

I will update this doc as progress continues.
